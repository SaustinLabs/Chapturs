---

## 🟡 Active / Growth

### Feed & Discovery

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 17 | Feed reads `community_genres` cookie for cold-start seeding | ✅ | Cookie read in feed API; genre-matching works floated to top for guest visitors arriving via community links |
| 18 | Browse page: filter by genre, tags, completion status, update frequency | ✅ | URL-driven `/browse` — genre pills, status/sort pills, cover-image grid, load-more; no search query required |

### Content Seeding

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 21 | Import 3–5 public domain works from Project Gutenberg | ✅ | 18 works, 606 chapters live on production. **July 5 bulk import:** added 13 works (Jekyll, 20K Leagues, Moby Dick, Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations, Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, Metamorphosis, Tom Sawyer, Wizard of Oz, Ben Franklin, Souls of Black Folk, Study in Scarlet). 5 failed (retryable Gutendex timeouts). Holmes duplicates + title corruption fixed. Pipeline stable with race-condition guard. |
| 22 | Generate AI glossary entries for imported works | ✅ | Built into pipeline (`generate-glossary.ts`). Asks LLM directly about the work rather than parsing raw text. Runs during import. |
| 23 | Generate character profiles for imported works | ✅ | Built into pipeline (`generate-characters.ts`). Same direct-LLM approach. Runs during import. |

### Outreach

All fire-and-forget. Unit tests in `src/__tests__/points.test.ts`. |
| 98 | Profile "Achievements / Level" block with user visibility toggle | ✅ | `AchievementsBlock.tsx` wired into profile page; `PATCH /api/achievements/[userId]/visibility` ready (gracefully no-op until User.showAchievements is pushed) |
| 99 | Pin featured achievements in profile block | ✅ | `FeaturedAchievements.tsx` with star pins; `PATCH /api/achievements/[userId]/featured` ready; 4-pin cap enforced server-side. |
| 100 | Founding Creator cohort badge (first 100 publishing authors) | ✅ | Wired June 2026. `checkAndAwardFoundingCreator` fires on chapter publish (both section create and status change to published). Fire-and-forget. |

| 110 | Publishing flow options in editor: upload document / paste document / continue writing | ✅ | Entry picker shown on new chapters: Write from scratch / Upload document / Paste text. Paste converts plain text to prose blocks and loads into editor. |
| 106 | Define release cadence UX (scheduled vs metadata-only) for beta publishing | ⬜ | Decide strict scheduling later if needed |
| 107 | Founder program policy doc for exact point values + award rules | ⬜ | Source-of-truth + public docs; values must be admin-editable in runtime settings to rebalance meta shifts |

### Notifications

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|

## 🔵 Known Code TODOs

These are literal `// TODO` comments in the codebase:

| # | File | Issue | Status | Notes |
|---|------|-------|--------|-------|
| 30 | `src/lib/r2-usage.ts:227` | Admin alert when R2 storage budget threshold hit | ✅ | Added \`notifyAdminStorageAlert\` and implemented in \`r2-usage.ts\` |
| 31 | `src/lib/ContentValidationService.ts:269` | Store content hashes for duplicate detection | ⬜ | |
| 32 | `src/lib/ContentValidationService.ts:463` | Integrate image safety API (currently no-op) | ✅ | Google Cloud Vision SafeSearch — flags adult/violence/racy LIKELY+ images; graceful fallback to URL check if key absent |
| 33 | `src/lib/analytics/view-counter.ts:187` | Add `viewCount` field to Section model in Prisma schema | ✅ | Implemented DB logic in \`view-counter.ts\` to use \`viewCount\` field which was already in schema |
| 34 | `src/app/api/works/publish/route.ts` | Wire content validation checks into publish flow | ✅ | Validates ALL sections (not just first); removed auto-approve; mature content confirmation modal wired; PrePublishChecklist calls server validation; new `/api/works/[id]/validate` dry-run endpoint. |
| 80 | `src/app/api/user/taste-profile/route.ts` | `workCount < 12` gate suppresses onboarding survey on sparse platform | ✅ | Lowered to `workCount < 3` — survey now fires with minimal seeded content |
| 114 | `package.json` | `groq-sdk` is listed as a dependency but architecture decision bans it (use OpenRouter only) | ✅ | Removed; confirmed no call sites — all LLM calls use `openai` SDK via OpenRouter |

---

## 🔵 Phase 3 — Collaborative Editor

Schema (`WorkCollaborator`, `CollaborationActivity`) is in the DB. Only the UI and business logic are missing.

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 35 | Co-author invite by username UI | ✅ | Creator hub invite flow is live at `/creator/works/[id]/collaborators`; API + UI wired, collaborator removal endpoint added |
| 36 | Role-based permissions (owner / editor / contributor) | ✅ | Permission enforcement (`canEdit`, `canPublish`) now covers all creator write endpoints: sections, characters, import, schedule. Collaborator checks are live; see PR for details. |
| 37 | Revenue share config per collaborator | ✅ | PATCH endpoint for role/revenueShare; GET returns revenueShare. Inline editor in collaborators hub. |
| 38 | Collaboration activity log | ✅ | Activity API at `GET /api/works/[id]/collaborators/activity` returning 50-item feed; UI panel live in Creator Hub showing actor, action, timestamp. |
| 39 | Chapter locking (prevent simultaneous edits) | ✅ | Durable database-backed locking now live. `SectionLock` Prisma model created. Lock API (`GET/POST/DELETE /api/works/[id]/sections/[sectionId]/lock`) uses database queries. Handles multi-instance deployments. Editor lock lifecycle (acquire/renew/release) + UI blocks fully integrated. Locks survive across restarts. |
| 40 | Change suggestion mode (propose edit → accept/reject) | ⬜ | |
| 41 | Version history with per-author attribution | ⬜ | |
| 42 | Real-time co-editing (WebSocket / Pusher / Ably) | ⬜ | |
| 43 | Live cursor presence | ⬜ | |

---

## 🔵 Phase 4 — Ecosystem Expansion

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 44 | Reader highlight → suggest typo/wording fix | 🔶 | Suggestion submission route hardened with canonical transitions/validation + shared permission guards. Existing chapter reader selection flow submits to edit-suggestions; remaining refinement is dedicated ChapterBlockRenderer-native popover wiring. |

| 47 | Series subscription (one click covers all works in a set) | ✅ | `/api/series/[id]/subscribe` (POST idempotent bulk-bookmark, DELETE removes). `SeriesSubscribeButton` client component with session-aware CTA. |
| 48 | Reader-to-reader recommendation ("finished X → also loved Y") | ✅ | `UserSignal(signalType='work_complete')` completion events via `POST /api/works/[id]/complete`. `src/lib/recommendations/reader-signals.ts` computes co-completion scores → `ContentSimilarity(similarityType='reader_to_reader')`. Integrated into `getRelatedWorks` cascade (layer 2b). Admin trigger extended; `reasonLabel` displayed on story pages. |
| 49 | "Readers Also Enjoyed" block on story pages | ✅ | Smart cascade: author picks → collaborative signals → reader-to-reader co-completion → semantic LLM Jaccard → trending → popular. `WorkSemanticProfile` + `AuthorRecommendation` schema, `similarity.ts` service, `/api/works/[id]/related` (now returns `reasonCode` + `reasonLabel`). |
| 49a | Author-curated "Readers Also Enjoyed" picks — Creator Hub UI | ✅ | Work-search autocomplete + pick list (max 4) added to `/creator/work/[id]/edit`. Auto-saves on add/remove. |
| 49b | Collaborative signal cron/trigger — periodically call `computeCollaborativeSignals` | ✅ | `.github/workflows/recommendation-refresh.yml` cron `0 */6 * * *` → `POST /api/admin/collaborative-signals` with `x-scheduler-secret` header.

## 💰 Monetization

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 66 | Enable Stripe integration (currently `premium_enabled: false`) | 🔶 | `premium_enabled` in SiteSettings; checkout gated. Flip to `'true'` in Admin → Settings to go live (zero redeploy). See `docs/operations/monetization-launch-checklist.md` for go-live steps. |

---

## 🎨 UX / Polish

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 70 | `/features` page — update screenshots/copy to reflect current state | 🔶 | Copy/status sync pass started; continue tightening claims as features go live |
| 109 | Keep `/about/roadmap` + `/features` synced with `TASKS.md` on every shipped/started feature | 🔶 | Workflow now enforced in agent instructions; continue updating copy/status in same commit as feature work |
| 71 | Landing page (`/`) — review copy for current feature set | ⬜ | |
| 72 | Empty states: new user sees an onboarding prompt instead of a blank feed | ✅ | Authenticated empty feed now launches TasteProfileSurvey modal; guests get genre quick-pick buttons |
| 73 | Mobile layout audit across all main flows (feed, reader, editor) | 🔶 | Fixed major blockers and added Playwright mobile smoke suite; remaining work is deeper manual QA for authenticated reader chapters on real device datasets |
| 74 | Error boundary messaging — make user-facing errors friendlier | ✅ | Global `error.tsx` and `ErrorBoundary` component already had good UI; fixed `StoryPageClient` to use a static friendly message instead of raw `err.message` (prevents "Failed to fetch" showing to readers) |
| 75 | Loading skeleton coverage — any page missing a skeleton while data loads | ⬜ | |
| 95 | Feed back-navigation: instant restore via module-level snapshot cache | ✅ | `src/lib/feedCache.ts` stores items+page+scroll on unmount; InfiniteFeed restores on mount (after auth settles); `staleTimes.dynamic: 30` added to next.config.js for router-level caching; taste-profile onboarding clears the cache so the fresh personalised feed always loads |

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 76 | Set up uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot / Better Uptime — free tier) | ⬜ | |
| 77 | Error reporting (Sentry free tier) — currently errors only go to console | 🔶 | Sentry SDK installed + configured (sentry.*.config.ts); `SENTRY_DSN` added to GitHub Secrets; graceful no-op if DSN not set. Deploy will activate on next VPS push. |
| 78 | Review VPS resource usage — RAM / disk / CPU headroom before traffic | ⬜ | |
| 79 | Log rotation on PM2 — ensure server logs don't fill the disk | ⬜ | |
| 113 | Cast Squad team via VS Code Agent mode (switch to Squad agent in Copilot Chat) | ✅ | Team cast: Danny (Lead), Linus (Frontend), Rusty (Backend), Basher (Tester), Scribe, Ralph. Universe: Ocean's Eleven. Charters + histories seeded with full Chapturs context. |

---

## 🌍 Translation System

Schema models (`Translation`, `TranslationSuggestion`, `TranslatorProfile`, `TranslationVote`, `FanTranslation`) are in place. Chapter reader has a language-selector UI. The content API route (`/api/chapter/[workId]/[chapterId]/content`) is wired and calls real LLM via `translateBatch`.

### Phase 1 — MVP (in progress)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 83 | Real LLM translation in chapter content route | ✅ | `translateBatch` from `src/lib/translation.ts` wired into content route; uses `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct` via OpenRouter |
| 84 | Fix `translation.ts` — remove broken `DescriptionTranslation` ref, correct model, batch API | ✅ | Rewrote: `translateOnDemand` + `translateBatch`, correct model, no broken Prisma calls |
| 85 | Add `preferredLanguage` field to User model + migrate | ✅ | Added `preferredLanguage String? @default("en")` to User model; migrated via `prisma db push` in deploy workflow |
| 86 | Pass `Accept-Language` / user preference as default `targetLanguage` in chapter page | ✅ | On mount: fetches user profile preference first, falls back to `navigator.language`; applies if in SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES |
| 87 | "Translated from X • Show original" banner in chapter reader | ✅ | Banner renders below chapter title when `targetLanguage !== 'en'`; one-tap revert resets language + detectedLanguage state |

### Phase 2 — Quality & Cost Controls

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 88 | Persist AI translations to DB (`FanTranslation` model, `TIER_1_OFFICIAL`) to avoid re-translating | ✅ | Fixed FK bug (`translatorId: null`); switched `create` → `upsert` on `(chapterId, languageCode, tier)` unique key; fire-and-forget `.catch()` so persist never blocks the response |
| 89 | Rate-limit translation requests per user/IP (e.g. 20 chapters/day for anon) | ✅ | In-memory sliding-window limiter (20 req/hr per IP) added to content route; purges stale entries every hour; sufficient until Redis is available |
| 90 | Chunk large chapters into ≤50 block batches before sending to LLM | ✅ | Added `translateBatchChunked` to `translation.ts`; auto-splits arrays >50 entries into sequential chunk calls; content route now uses this |

### Phase 3 — Community Translations (future)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 91 | `TranslationSuggestion` submission UI — bilingual readers can propose better translations | ✅ | Inline suggestion form in chapter reader translation banner; POSTs to new `/api/fan-translations/[id]/suggest` endpoint |
| 92 | Voting UI for translation suggestions | ✅ | Star rating widget (1–5) in translation banner; POSTs to new `/api/fan-translations/[id]/rate`; resets on language change |
| 93 | Auto-promote community translation to canonical when votes > threshold | ✅ | Auto-promote fires in rate endpoint when ratingCount ≥ 5 and avgQuality ≥ 4.0; updates `section.defaultTranslationIdByLanguage` |
| 94 | `TranslatorProfile` hub — track translator reputation and language badges | ⬜ | Schema exists; needs UI in Creator Hub |

LLM now emits structured `semanticProfile` alongside QA assessment (zero extra cost). `ContentSimilarity` table auto-populated after every QA run. |
| Author-curated companion works API — `PUT /api/works/[id]/author-recommendations` (max 4, auth-gated to work owner) |
| Maturity gate (#11) — `MaturityGate.tsx` interstitial for R/NC-17 stories; localStorage consent; wired into `/story/[id]` |
