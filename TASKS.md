## 🔴 Immediate / Blocking (do these now)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Run bootstrap flow: sign in → `/admin/bootstrap` → enter PIN → sign out → sign back in | ⬜ | Deploy `0363768` must finish first |
| 2 | Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` + `EMAIL_FROM` are in GitHub Secrets | ⬜ | Without these, all transactional emails are silently dropped |
| 3 | Run `npx prisma db push` on the production DB | ⬜ | Schema has `CommunityLink.signupCount` + `User.communityRef` that aren't pushed yet |
| 4 | Set up Admin → Settings → Email Addresses in the admin panel | ⬜ | New email group defaults to `@chapturs.com` values but needs to be confirmed/customised after first deploy |

## 🟠 Pre-Launch Essentials

### Infrastructure
| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | Cloudflare Email Routing for all inboxes | ✅ | Done by user |
| 6 | Confirm domain DNS is healthy (R2, Resend DKIM, CF email routing coexist) | ⬜ | Worth a quick audit |
| 7 | Test welcome email end-to-end with a fresh signup | ⬜ | New code — verify Resend actually fires |
| 8 | Test chapter rejection email end-to-end | ⬜ | New code — requires a moderation queue item |

### Legal & Content Policy
| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9 | Write a dedicated DMCA policy page (`/dmca`) | ⬜ | `dmca@` address now exists, but there's no formal policy page — legally expected |
| 10 | Review Terms of Service — ensure it mentions AI-generated content rules | ⬜ | With AI author bots planned, terms should cover this now |
| 11 | Age verification / parental advisory for mature-rated works | ⬜ | Maturity rating field exists, no reader-side gate |
| 12 | Privacy policy audit — confirm GDPR/CCPA delete-account flow works | ⬜ | Delete account doesn't appear to be wired up end-to-end |

### SEO & Discoverability
| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 13 | Audit sitemap.ts — confirm all public story/author pages are included | 🔶 | File exists, unknown if comprehensive |
| 14 | Per-story `og:image` meta tags using cover art | ✅ | Fixed `resolveCoverSrc` bug in story layout — was passing wrong args, now returns correct absolute URL |
| 15 | Per-chapter `og:description` using chapter hook / first paragraph | ✅ | Chapter layout also fixed — og:image now works for chapter social shares |
| 16 | Canonical URLs on paginated/filtered pages | ⬜ | Feed has filters that may create duplicate URL issues |

## 🟡 Phase 2 — Growth Tools (active sprint)

### Feed & Discovery

| 18 | Browse page: filter by genre, tags, completion status, update frequency | ⬜ | Search exists, no browse/filter experience |
| 19 | "New and Promising" section on homepage | ⬜ | For AI-scored strong chapters by new creators — easy retention win |

### Content Seeding

| 26 | Generate community referral links for target communities (RoyalRoad LitRPG, Wattpad Romance etc.) | ⬜ | Use admin community links panel |

### Notifications
| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 27 | In-app notification centre (bell icon, unread count) | 🔶 | Schema exists, UI needs building |
| 28 | Weekly email digest of activity on followed works | ⬜ | Requires batching logic / cron job |
