## 🔴 Immediate / Blocking (do these now)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Run bootstrap flow: sign in → `/admin/bootstrap` → enter PIN → sign out → sign back in | ⬜ | Deploy `0363768` must finish first |
| 2 | Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` + `EMAIL_FROM` are in GitHub Secrets | ⬜ | Without these, all transactional emails are silently dropped |
| 3 | Run `npx prisma db push` on the production DB | ⬜ | Schema has `CommunityLink.signupCount` + `User.communityRef` that aren't pushed yet |
| 4 | Set up Admin → Settings → Email Addresses in the admin panel | ⬜ | New email group defaults to `@chapturs.com` values but needs to be confirmed/customised after first deploy |

## 🟠 Pre-Launch Essentials

### Infrastructure

### SEO & Discoverability
| # | Task | Status | Notes |

| 14 | Per-story `og:image` meta tags using cover art | ✅ | Fixed `resolveCoverSrc` bug in story layout — was passing wrong args, now returns correct absolute URL |
| 15 | Per-chapter `og:description` using chapter hook / first paragraph | ✅ | Chapter layout also fixed — og:image now works for chapter social shares |
| 16 | Canonical URLs on paginated/filtered pages | ⬜ | Feed has filters that may create duplicate URL issues |

---

## 🟡 Phase 2 — Growth Tools (active sprint)

### Feed & Discovery
| # | Task | Status | Notes |

| 23 | Generate character profiles for imported works | ⬜ | Use existing character profile system |

### Outreach
| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 24 | Founding Creator Programme — identify 5–10 mid-tier targets on RoyalRoad/Wattpad | ⬜ | 1k–8k followers frustrated with current platforms |

| 101 | "First!" reader window + anti-farm qualification | ⬜ | Chapter goes live -> 5 minute award window. Reader must qualify (>=60s dwell + basic scroll/progress signal) before award; all qualified readers in window receive badge/points |

### Notifications
| # | Task | Status | Notes |

---

| 49a | Author-curated "Readers Also Enjoyed" picks — Creator Hub UI | ⬜ | API exists (`PUT /api/works/[id]/author-recommendations`, max 4). Need a work-search autocomplete + list UI in Story Management settings. |
| 49b | Collaborative signal cron/trigger — periodically call `computeCollaborativeSignals` | ⬜ | Hook exists; needs a scheduled API route or admin trigger to run it for works with sufficient readership. |

---

## 🎨 UX / Polish

| # | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 70 | `/features` page — update screenshots/copy to reflect current state | 🔶 | Copy/status sync pass started; continue tightening claims as features go live |
| 109 | Keep `/about/roadmap` + `/features` synced with `TASKS.md` on every shipped/started feature | 🔶 | Workflow now enforced in agent instructions; continue updating copy/status in same commit as feature work |
| 71 | Landing page (`/`) — review copy for current feature set | ⬜ |
| 72 | Empty states: new user sees an onboarding prompt instead of a blank feed | ✅ | Authenticated empty feed now launches TasteProfileSurvey modal; guests get genre quick-pick buttons |
| 73 | Mobile layout audit across all main flows (feed, reader, editor) | 🔶 | Fixed major blockers and added Playwright mobile smoke suite; remaining work is deeper manual QA for authenticated reader chapters on real device datasets |
| 74 | Error boundary messaging — make user-facing errors friendlier | ✅ | Global `error.tsx` and `ErrorBoundary` component already had good UI; fixed `StoryPageClient` to use a static friendly message instead of raw `err.message` (prevents "Failed to fetch" showing to readers) |
| 75 | Loading skeleton coverage — any page missing a skeleton while data loads | ⬜ |
| 95 | Feed back-navigation: instant restore via module-level snapshot cache | ✅ | `src/lib/feedCache.ts` stores items+page+scroll on unmount; InfiniteFeed restores on mount (after auth settles); `staleTimes.dynamic: 30` added to next.config.js for router-level caching; taste-profile onboarding clears the cache so the fresh personalised feed always loads |
| 82 | Add Playwright mobile smoke tests (feed/reader/editor) for regression checks | ✅ | Added `playwright.config.ts`, mobile smoke suite, and npm scripts (`test:e2e`, `test:e2e:mobile`) |
| 81 | Sidebar expand should overlay (no content reflow); verify reader alignment on desktop + mobile | ✅ | Implemented fixed content lane + sliding sidebar (no main-content reflow when expanding) |
| 108 | Rich text font-family support in editor toolbar (TipTap `FontFamily`) | ⬜ | Add curated families, persist in block content, keep default serif fallback |

---

## 📊 Analytics & Monitoring

| # | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 76 | Set up uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot / Better Uptime — free tier) | ⬜ |
| 77 | Error reporting (Sentry free tier) — currently errors only go to console | ⬜ |
| 78 | Review VPS resource usage — RAM / disk / CPU headroom before traffic | ⬜ |
| 79 | Log rotation on PM2 — ensure server logs don't fill the disk | ⬜ |

---

## 🌍 Translation System

Schema models (`Translation`, `TranslationSuggestion`, `TranslatorProfile`, `TranslationVote`, `FanTranslation`) are in place. Chapter reader has a language-selector UI. The content API route (`/api/chapter/[workId]/[chapterId]/content`) is wired and calls real LLM via `translateBatch`.

### Phase 1 — MVP (in progress)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 83 | Real LLM translation in chapter content route | ✅ | `translateBatch` from `src/lib/translation.ts` wired into content route; uses `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct` via OpenRouter |
| 84 | Fix `translation.ts` — remove broken `DescriptionTranslation` ref, correct model, batch API | ✅ | Rewrote: `translateOnDemand` + `translateBatch`, correct model, no broken Prisma calls |
| 85 | Add `preferredLanguage` field to User model + migrate | ✅ | Added `preferredLanguage String? @default("en")` to User model; migrated via `prisma db push` in deploy workflow |
| 86 | Pass `Accept-Language` / user preference as default `targetLanguage` in chapter page | ✅ | On mount: fetches user profile preference first, falls back to `navigator.language`; applies if in SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES |
| 87 | "Translated from X • Show original" banner in chapter reader | ✅ | Banner renders below chapter title when `targetLanguage !== 'en'`; one-tap revert resets language + detectedLanguage state |

### Phase 2 — Quality & Cost Controls

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 88 | Persist AI translations to DB (`FanTranslation` model, `TIER_1_OFFICIAL`) to avoid re-translating | ✅ | Fixed FK bug (`translatorId: null`); switched `create` → `upsert` on `(chapterId, languageCode, tier)` unique key; fire-and-forget `.catch()` so persist never blocks the response |
| 89 | Rate-limit translation requests per user/IP (e.g. 20 chapters/day for anon) | ✅ | In-memory sliding-window limiter (20 req/hr per IP) added to content route; purges stale entries every hour; sufficient until Redis is available |
| 90 | Chunk large chapters into ≤50 block batches before sending to LLM | ✅ | Added `translateBatchChunked` to `translation.ts`; auto-splits arrays >50 entries into sequential chunk calls; content route now uses this |

### Phase 3 — Community Translations (future)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 91 | `TranslationSuggestion` submission UI — bilingual readers can propose better translations | ✅ | Inline suggestion form in chapter reader translation banner; POSTs to new `/api/fan-translations/[id]/suggest` endpoint |
| 92 | Voting UI for translation suggestions | ✅ | Star rating widget (1–5) in translation banner; POSTs to new `/api/fan-translations/[id]/rate`; resets on language change |
| 93 | Auto-promote community translation to canonical when votes > threshold | ✅ | Auto-promote fires in rate endpoint when ratingCount ≥ 5 and avgQuality ≥ 4.0; updates `section.defaultTranslationIdByLanguage` |
| 94 | `TranslatorProfile` hub — track translator reputation and language badges | ⬜ | Schema exists; needs UI in Creator Hub |
