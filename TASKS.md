## 🟡 Active / Growth

### Feed & Discovery

| # | Task | Status | Notes |

Implement `POST /api/admin/import/gutenberg` + service in `src/lib/gutenberg-import/`. Suggested works: *Dracula* (#345), *Count of Monte Cristo* (#1184), *Twenty Thousand Leagues* (#164), *Pride and Prejudice* (#1342), *Jekyll and Hyde* (#43). **UNBLOCKED** — AI story writer bots off-limits restriction removed; workers may now implement this task. Import endpoint exists at `api/works/[id]/import` for universal story ingestion (DOCX/PDF parsing via mammoth + pdf-parse). |
| 22 | Generate AI glossary entries for imported works | 🔶 | Covered by Gutenberg import pipeline spec (Step 6). Function: `generateGlossaryForWork()` in `src/lib/gutenberg-import/generate-glossary.ts`. Uses OpenRouter `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct`.

| 97 | Points event pipeline (`POINTS_EVENT_TYPE`) for reader/author/contributor triggers | ✅ | `awardPoints` wired: chapter publish (10pts + founding_creator check), glossary new entry (5pts), comment (3pts), first read per work (5pts). All fire-and-forget. Unit tests in `src/__tests__/points.test.ts`. |
| 98 | Profile "Achievements / Level" block with user visibility toggle | ✅ | `AchievementsBlock.tsx` wired into profile page; `PATCH /api/achievements/[userId]/visibility` ready (gracefully no-op until User.showAchievements is pushed) |
| 99 | Pin featured achievements in profile block | ✅ | `FeaturedAchievements.tsx` with star pins; `PATCH /api/achievements/[userId]/featured` ready; 4-pin cap enforced server-side. |
| 100 | Founding Creator cohort badge (first 100 publishing authors) | ⬜ | Trigger on first chapter that goes live (not draft/save); store award timestamp + chapterId |
| 101 | "First!" reader window + anti-farm qualification | ⬜ | Chapter goes live → 5 minute award window. Reader must qualify (>=60s dwell + basic scroll/progress signal) before award; all qualified readers in window receive badge/points |

| 110 | Publishing flow options in editor: upload document / paste document / continue writing | ✅ | Entry picker shown on new chapters: Write from scratch / Upload document / Paste text. Paste converts plain text to prose blocks and loads into editor. |
| 106 | Define release cadence UX (scheduled vs metadata-only) for beta publishing | ⬜ | Decide strict scheduling later if needed |
| 107 | Founder program policy doc for exact point values + award rules | ⬜ | Source-of-truth + public docs; values must be admin-editable in runtime settings to rebalance meta shifts |

### Notifications

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 27 | In-app notification centre (bell icon, unread count) | ✅ | Bell on desktop sidebar + mobile bottom nav Alerts tab; full `/notifications` page; per-notification mark-as-read; 60s polling |

## 🔵 Known Code TODOs

These are literal `// TODO` comments in the codebase:

| # | File | Issue | Status | Notes |
|---|------|-------|--------|-------|
| 30 | `src/lib/r2-usage.ts:227` | Admin alert when R2 storage budget threshold hit | ✅ | Added \`notifyAdminStorageAlert\` and implemented in \`r2-usage.ts\` |
| 31 | `src/lib/ContentValidationService.ts:269` | Store content hashes for duplicate detection | ⬜ | ContentValidationService.ts exists at ~17KB (526 lines); hash storage not yet implemented. |
| 32 | `src/lib/ContentValidationService.ts:463` | Integrate image safety API (currently no-op) | ✅ | Google Cloud Vision SafeSearch — flags adult/violence/racy LIKELY+ images; graceful fallback to URL check if key absent |
| 33 | `src/lib/analytics/view-counter.ts:187` | Add `viewCount` field to Section model in Prisma schema | ✅ | Implemented DB logic in \`view-counter.ts\` to use \`viewCount\` field which was already in schema |
| 34 | `src/app/api/works/publish/route.ts` | Wire content validation checks into publish flow | ✅ | Validates ALL sections (not just first); removed auto-approve; mature content confirmation modal wired; PrePublishChecklist calls server validation; new `/api/works/[id]/validate` dry-run endpoint. |
| 80 | `src/app/api/user/taste-profile/route.ts` | `workCount < 12` gate suppresses onboarding survey on sparse platform | ✅ | Lowered to `workCount < 3` — survey now fires with minimal seeded content |
| 114 | `package.json` | `groq-sdk` is listed as a dependency but architecture decision bans it (use OpenRouter only) | ✅ | Removed; confirmed no call sites — all LLM calls use `openai` SDK via OpenRouter |

---

## 🔵 Phase 3 — Collaborative Editor

Schema (`WorkCollaborator`, `CollaborationActivity`) is in the DB. Only the UI and business logic are missing.

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 35 | Co-author invite by username UI | ✅ | Creator hub invite flow is live at `/creator/works/[id]/collaborators`; API + UI wired, collaborator removal endpoint added |
| 36 | Role-based permissions (owner / editor / contributor) | ✅ | Permission enforcement (`canEdit`, `canPublish`) now covers all creator write endpoints: sections, characters, import, schedule. Collaborator checks are live; see PR for details. |
| 37 | Revenue share config per collaborator | ✅ | PATCH endpoint for role/revenueShare; GET returns revenueShare. Inline editor in collaborators hub. |
| 38 | Collaboration activity log | ✅ | Activity API at `GET /api/works/[id]/collaborators/activity` returning 50-item feed; UI panel live in Creator Hub showing actor, action, timestamp. |
| 39 | Chapter locking (prevent simultaneous edits) | ✅ | Durable database-backed locking now live. `SectionLock` Prisma model created. Lock API (`GET/POST/DELETE /api/works/[id]/sections/[sectionId]/lock`) uses database queries. Handles multi-instance deployments. Editor lock lifecycle (acquire/renew/release) + UI blocks fully integrated. Locks survive across restarts. |
| 40 | Change suggestion mode (propose edit → accept/reject) | ⬜ | |
| 41 | Version history with per-author attribution | ⬜ | |
| 42 | Real-time co-editing (WebSocket / Pusher / Ably) | ⬜ | |
| 43 | Live cursor presence | ⬜ | |

---

## 🔵 Phase 4 — Ecosystem Expansion

|| # | Task | Status | Notes |
||---|------|--------|-------|
|| 44 | Reader highlight → suggest typo/wording fix | 🔶 | Suggestion submission route hardened with canonical transitions/validation + shared permission guards. Existing chapter reader selection flow submits to edit-suggestions; remaining refinement is dedicated ChapterBlockRenderer-native popover wiring. `src/lib/suggestions/suggestion-permissions.ts` provides permission checks. |
|| 45 | Creator accept/reject queue for reader suggestions | ✅ | Added grouped moderation queue API (`/api/creator/suggestions/queue`) + new `CreatorSuggestionQueue` UI and updated creator suggestion page integration. |

|| 48 | Reader-to-reader recommendation ("finished X → also loved Y") | ✅ | `UserSignal(signalType='work_complete')` completion events via `POST /api/works/[id]/complete`. `src/lib/recommendations/reader-signals.ts` computes co-completion scores → `ContentSimilarity(similarityType='reader_to_reader')`. Integrated into `getRelatedWorks` cascade (layer 2b). Admin trigger extended; `reasonLabel` displayed on story pages. |
|| 49 | "Readers Also Enjoyed" block on story pages | ✅ | Smart cascade: author picks → collaborative signals → reader-to-reader co-completion → semantic LLM Jaccard → trending → popular. `WorkSemanticProfile` + `AuthorRecommendation` schema, `similarity.ts` service, `/api/works/[id]/related` (now returns `reasonCode` + `reasonLabel`). |
|| 49a | Author-curated "Readers Also Enjoyed" picks — Creator Hub UI | ✅ | Work-search autocomplete + pick list (max 4) added to `/creator/work/[id]/edit`. Auto-saves on add/remove. |
|| 49b | Collaborative signal cron/trigger — periodically call `computeCollaborativeSignals` | ✅ | `.github/workflows/recommendation-refresh.yml` cron `0 */6 * * *` → `POST /api/admin/collaborative-signals` with `x-scheduler-secret` header. Runs collaborative + reader-to-reader together. Add `ADMIN_SCHEDULER_SECRET` to GitHub Actions Secrets. |

---

## 💰 Monetization

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 66 | Enable Stripe integration (currently `premium_enabled: false`) | 🔶 | `premium_enabled` in SiteSettings; checkout gated. Flip to `'true'` in Admin → Settings to go live (zero redeploy). See `docs/operations/monetization-launch-checklist.md` for go-live steps. |
| 67 | Test Stripe webhook end-to-end on staging | 🔶 | Webhook idempotency + `StripeEventLog` implemented; admin event log API; local verification script.

---

## 🎨 UX / Polish

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 70 | `/features` page — update screenshots/copy to reflect current state | 🔶 | Copy/status sync pass started; continue tightening claims as features go live |
| 109 | Keep `/about/roadmap` + `/features` synced with `TASKS.md` on every shipped/started feature | 🔶 | Workflow now enforced in agent instructions; continue updating copy/status in same commit as feature work |
| 71 | Landing page (`/`) — review copy for current feature set | ⬜ | |
| 72 | Empty states: new user sees an onboarding prompt instead of a blank feed | ✅ | Authenticated empty feed now launches TasteProfileSurvey modal; guests get genre quick-pick buttons |
| 73 | Mobile layout audit across all main flows (feed, reader, editor) | 🔶 | Fixed major blockers and added Playwright mobile smoke suite; remaining work is deeper manual QA for authenticated reader chapters on real device datasets |
| 74 | Error boundary messaging — make user-facing errors friendlier | ✅ | Global `error.tsx` and `ErrorBoundary` component already had good UI; fixed `StoryPageClient` to use a static friendly message instead of raw `err.message` (prevents "Failed to fetch" showing to readers) |
| 75 | Loading skeleton coverage — any page missing a skeleton while data loads | ⬜ | |
| 95 | Feed back-navigation: instant restore via module-level snapshot cache | ✅ | `src/lib/feedCache.ts` stores items+page+scroll on unmount; InfiniteFeed restores on mount (after auth settles); `staleTimes.dynamic: 30` added to next.config.js for router-level caching; taste-profile onboarding clears the cache so the fresh personalised feed always loads |

## 📊 Analytics & Monitoring

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 76 | Set up uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot / Better Uptime — free tier) | ⬜ | |
| 77 | Error reporting (Sentry free tier) — currently errors only go to console | 🔶 | Sentry SDK installed + configured (sentry.*.config.ts); `SENTRY_DSN` added to GitHub Secrets; graceful no-op if DSN not set. Deploy will activate on next VPS push. |
| 78 | Review VPS resource usage — RAM / disk / CPU headroom before traffic | ⬜ | |
| 79 | Log rotation on PM2 — ensure server logs don't fill the disk | ⬜ | |
| 113 | Cast Squad team via VS Code Agent mode (switch to Squad agent in Copilot Chat) | ✅ | Team cast: Danny (Lead), Linus (Frontend), Rusty (Backend), Basher (Tester), Scribe, Ralph. Universe: Ocean's Eleven. Charters + histories seeded with full Chapturs context. |

---

## 🌍 Translation System

Schema models (`Translation`, `TranslationSuggestion`, `TranslatorProfile`, `TranslationVote`, `FanTranslation`) are in place. Chapter reader has a language-selector UI. The content API route (`/api/chapter/[workId]/[chapterId]/content`) is wired and calls real LLM via `translateBatch`.

### Phase 1 — MVP (in progress)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 83 | Real LLM translation in chapter content route | ✅ | `translateBatch` from `src/lib/translation.ts` wired into content route; uses `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct` via OpenRouter |
| 84 | Fix `translation.ts` — remove broken `DescriptionTranslation` ref, correct model, batch API | ✅ | Rewrote: `translateOnDemand` + `translateBatch`, correct model, no broken Prisma calls |
| 85 | Add `preferredLanguage` field to User model + migrate | ✅ | Added `preferredLanguage String? @default("en")` to User model; migrated via `prisma db push` in deploy workflow |
| 86 | Pass `Accept-Language` / user preference as default `targetLanguage` in chapter page | ✅ | On mount: fetches user profile preference first, falls back to `navigator.language`; applies if in SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES |
| 87 | "Translated from X • Show original" banner in chapter reader | ✅ | Banner renders below chapter title when `targetLanguage !== 'en'`; one-tap revert resets language + detectedLanguage state |

### Phase 2 — Quality & Cost Controls

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 88 | Persist AI translations to DB (`FanTranslation` model, `TIER_1_OFFICIAL`) to avoid re-translating | ✅ | Fixed FK bug (`translatorId: null`); switched `create` → `upsert` on `(chapterId, languageCode, tier)` unique key; fire-and-forget `.catch()` so persist never blocks the response |
| 89 | Rate-limit translation requests per user/IP (e.g. 20 chapters/day for anon) | ✅ | In-memory sliding-window limiter (20 req/hr per IP) added to content route; purges stale entries every hour; sufficient until Redis is available |
| 90 | Chunk large chapters into ≤50 block batches before sending to LLM | ✅ | Added `translateBatchChunked` to `translation.ts`; auto-splits arrays >50 entries into sequential chunk calls; content route now uses this |

### Phase 3 — Community Translations (future)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 91 | `TranslationSuggestion` submission UI — bilingual readers can propose better translations | ✅ | Inline suggestion form in chapter reader translation banner; POSTs to new `/api/fan-translations/[id]/suggest` endpoint |
| 92 | Voting UI for translation suggestions | ✅ | Star rating widget (1–5) in translation banner; POSTs to new `/api/fan-translations/[id]/rate`; resets on language change |
| 93 | Auto-promote community translation to canonical when votes > threshold | ✅ | Auto-promote fires in rate endpoint when ratingCount ≥ 5 and avgQuality ≥ 4.0; updates `section.defaultTranslationIdByLanguage` |
| 94 | `TranslatorProfile` hub — track translator reputation and language badges | ⬜ | Schema exists; needs UI in Creator Hub |
