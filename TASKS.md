| 106 | Define release cadence UX (scheduled vs metadata-only) for beta publishing | ⬜ | Decide strict scheduling later if needed |
| 107 | Founder program policy doc for exact point values + award rules | ⬜ | Source-of-truth + public docs; values must be admin-editable in runtime settings to rebalance meta shifts |

### Notifications

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 27 | In-app notification centre (bell icon, unread count) | ✅ | Bell on desktop sidebar + mobile bottom nav Alerts tab; full `/notifications` page; per-notification mark-as-read; 60s polling |

---

## 🎨 UX / Polish

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 70 | `/features` page — update screenshots/copy to reflect current state | 🔶 | Copy/status sync pass started; continue tightening claims as features go live |
| 109 | Keep `/about/roadmap` + `/features` synced with `TASKS.md` on every shipped/started feature | 🔶 | Workflow now enforced in agent instructions; continue updating copy/status in same commit as feature work |
| 71 | Landing page (`/`) — review copy for current feature set | ⬜ | |
| 72 | Empty states: new user sees an onboarding prompt instead of a blank feed | ✅ | Authenticated empty feed now launches TasteProfileSurvey modal; guests get genre quick-pick buttons |
| 73 | Mobile layout audit across all main flows (feed, reader, editor) | 🔶 | Fixed major blockers and added Playwright mobile smoke suite; remaining work is deeper manual QA for authenticated reader chapters on real device datasets |
| 74 | Error boundary messaging — make user-facing errors friendlier | ✅ | Global `error.tsx` and `ErrorBoundary` component already had good UI; fixed `StoryPageClient` to use a static friendly message instead of raw `err.message` (prevents "Failed to fetch" showing to readers) |
| 75 | Loading skeleton coverage — any page missing a skeleton while data loads | ⬜ | |
| 95 | Feed back-navigation: instant restore via module-level snapshot cache | ✅ | `src/lib/feedCache.ts` stores items+page+scroll on unmount; InfiniteFeed restores on mount (after auth settles); `staleTimes.dynamic: 30` added to next.config.js for router-level caching; taste-profile onboarding clears the cache so the fresh personalised feed always loads |
| 82 | Add Playwright mobile smoke tests (feed/reader/editor) for regression checks | ✅ | Added `playwright.config.ts`, mobile smoke suite, and npm scripts (`test:e2e`, `test:e2e:mobile`) |

## 📊 Analytics & Monitoring

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 76 | Set up uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot / Better Uptime — free tier) | ⬜ | |
| 77 | Error reporting (Sentry free tier) — currently errors only go to console | 🔶 | Sentry SDK installed + configured (sentry.*.config.ts); `SENTRY_DSN` added to GitHub Secrets; graceful no-op if DSN not set. Deploy will activate on next VPS push. |
| 78 | Review VPS resource usage — RAM / disk / CPU headroom before traffic | ⬜ | |
| 79 | Log rotation on PM2 — ensure server logs don't fill the disk | ⬜ | |
| 113 | Cast Squad team via VS Code Agent mode (switch to Squad agent in Copilot Chat) | ✅ | Team cast: Danny (Lead), Linus (Frontend), Rusty (Backend), Basher (Tester), Scribe, Ralph. Universe: Ocean's Eleven. Charters + histories seeded with full Chapturs context. |

---

## 🌍 Translation System

Schema models (`Translation`, `TranslationSuggestion`, `TranslatorProfile`, `TranslationVote`, `FanTranslation`) are in place. Chapter reader has a language-selector UI. The content API route (`/api/chapter/[workId]/[chapterId]/content`) is wired and calls real LLM via `translateBatch`.

### Phase 1 — MVP (in progress)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 83 | Real LLM translation in chapter content route | ✅ | `translateBatch` from `src/lib/translation.ts` wired into content route; uses `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct` via OpenRouter |
| 84 | Fix `translation.ts` — remove broken `DescriptionTranslation` ref, correct model, batch API | ✅ | Rewrote: `translateOnDemand` + `translateBatch`, correct model, no broken Prisma calls |
| 85 | Add `preferredLanguage` field to User model + migrate | ✅ | Added `preferredLanguage String? @default("en")` to User model; migrated via `prisma db push` in deploy workflow |
| 86 | Pass `Accept-Language` / user preference as default `targetLanguage` in chapter page | ✅ | On mount: fetches user profile preference first, falls back to `navigator.language`; applies if in SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES |
| 87 | "Translated from X • Show original" banner in chapter reader | ✅ | Banner renders below chapter title when `targetLanguage !== 'en'`; one-tap revert resets language + detectedLanguage state |

### Phase 2 — Quality & Cost Controls

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 88 | Persist AI translations to DB (`FanTranslation` model, `TIER_1_OFFICIAL`) to avoid re-translating | ✅ | Fixed FK bug (`translatorId: null`); switched `create` → `upsert` on `(chapterId, languageCode, tier)` unique key; fire-and-forget `.catch()` so persist never blocks the response |
| 89 | Rate-limit translation requests per user/IP (e.g. 20 chapters/day for anon) | ✅ | In-memory sliding-window limiter (20 req/hr per IP) added to content route; purges stale entries every hour; sufficient until Redis is available |
| 90 | Chunk large chapters into ≤50 block batches before sending to LLM | ✅ | Added `translateBatchChunked` to `translation.ts`; auto-splits arrays >50 entries into sequential chunk calls; content route now uses this |

### Phase 3 — Community Translations (future)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 91 | `TranslationSuggestion` submission UI — bilingual readers can propose better translations | ✅ | Inline suggestion form in chapter reader translation banner; POSTs to new `/api/fan-translations/[id]/suggest` endpoint |
| 92 | Voting UI for translation suggestions | ✅ | Star rating widget (1–5) in translation banner; POSTs to new `/api/fan-translations/[id]/rate`; resets on language change |
| 93 | Auto-promote community translation to canonical when votes > threshold | ✅ | Auto-promote fires in rate endpoint when ratingCount ≥ 5 and avgQuality ≥ 4.0; updates `section.defaultTranslationIdByLanguage` |
| 94 | `TranslatorProfile` hub — track translator reputation and language badges | ⬜ | Schema exists; needs UI in Creator Hub |
