---

## 🔴 Immediate / Blocking (do these now)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Run bootstrap flow: sign in → `/admin/bootstrap` → enter PIN → sign out → sign back in | ⬜ | Deploy `0363768` must finish first |
| 2 | Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` + `EMAIL_FROM` are in GitHub Secrets | ⬜ | Without these, all transactional emails are silently dropped |
| 3 | Run `npx prisma db push` on the production DB | ⬜ | Schema has `CommunityLink.signupCount` + `User.communityRef` that aren't pushed yet |
| 4 | Set up Admin → Settings → Email Addresses in the admin panel | ⬜ | New email group defaults to `@chapturs.com` values but needs to be confirmed/customised after first deploy |

## 🟠 Pre-Launch Essentials

### Infrastructure
| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | Cloudflare Email Routing for all inboxes | ✅ | Done by user |
| 6 | Confirm domain DNS is healthy (R2, Resend DKIM, CF email routing coexist) | ⬜ | Worth a quick audit |
| 7 | Test welcome email end-to-end with a fresh signup | ⬜ | New code — verify Resend actually fires |
| 8 | Test chapter rejection email end-to-end | ⬜ | New code — requires a moderation queue item |

### Legal & Content Policy
| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9 | Write a dedicated DMCA policy page (`/dmca`) | ⬜ | `dmca@` address now exists, but there's no formal policy page — legally expected |
| 10 | Review Terms of Service — ensure it mentions AI-generated content rules | ⬜ | With AI author bots planned, terms should cover this now |
| 11 | Age verification / parental advisory for mature-rated works | ⬜ | Maturity rating field exists, no reader-side gate |
| 12 | Privacy policy audit — confirm GDPR/CCPA delete-account flow works | ⬜ | Delete account doesn't appear to be wired up end-to-end |

### SEO & Discoverability
| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 13 | Audit sitemap.ts — confirm all public story/author pages are included | 🔶 | File exists, unknown if comprehensive |
| 14 | Per-story `og:image` meta tags using cover art | ✅ | Fixed `resolveCoverSrc` bug in story layout — was passing wrong args, now returns correct absolute URL |
| 15 | Per-chapter `og:description` using chapter hook / first paragraph | ✅ | Chapter layout also fixed — og:image now works for chapter social shares |
| 16 | Canonical URLs on paginated/filtered pages | ⬜ | Feed has filters that may create duplicate URL issues |

---

## 🟡 Phase 2 — Growth Tools (active sprint)

### Feed & Discovery
| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 17 | Feed reads `community_genres` cookie for cold-start seeding | ✅ | Cookie read in feed API; genre-matching works floated to top for guest visitors arriving via community links |
| 18 | Browse page: filter by genre, tags, completion status, update frequency | ⬜ | Search exists, no browse/filter experience |
| 19 | "New and Promising" section on homepage | ⬜ | For AI-scored strong chapters by new creators — easy retention win |
| 20 | Trending page | ⬜ | Beyond the feed — dedicated trending works list |

### Content Seeding
| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 21 | Import 3–5 public domain works from Project Gutenberg | ⬜ | Feature demo content — cover art, AI glossary, character profiles. Suggested: *The Count of Monte Cristo*, *Dracula*, *Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea* |
| 22 | Generate AI glossary entries for imported works | ⬜ | Use existing Groq integration |
| 23 | Generate character profiles for imported works | ⬜ | Use existing character profile system |

### Outreach
| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 24 | Founding Creator Programme — identify 5–10 mid-tier targets on RoyalRoad/Wattpad | ⬜ | 1k–8k followers frustrated with current platforms |
| 25 | Draft the founding creator pitch email | ⬜ | 70% rev share for 12 months + founding badge + direct dev access |
| 26 | Generate community referral links for target communities (RoyalRoad LitRPG, Wattpad Romance etc.) | ⬜ | Use admin community links panel |

### Notifications
| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 27 | In-app notification centre (bell icon, unread count) | 🔶 | Schema exists, UI needs building |
| 28 | Weekly email digest of activity on followed works | ⬜ | Requires batching logic / cron job |
| 29 | Web push notifications (service worker) | ⬜ | Nice-to-have, after in-app centre |

| 67 | Test Stripe webhook end-to-end on staging | ⬜ | `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set but webhook flow is untested |

| 78 | Review VPS resource usage — RAM / disk / CPU headroom before traffic | ⬜ |
| 79 | Log rotation on PM2 — ensure server logs don't fill the disk | ⬜ |

---

## 🌍 Translation System

Schema models (`Translation`, `TranslationSuggestion`, `TranslatorProfile`, `TranslationVote`, `FanTranslation`) are in place. Chapter reader has a language-selector UI. The content API route (`/api/chapter/[workId]/[chapterId]/content`) is wired and calls real LLM via `translateBatch`.

### Phase 1 — MVP (in progress)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 83 | Real LLM translation in chapter content route | ✅ | `translateBatch` from `src/lib/translation.ts` wired into content route; uses `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct` via OpenRouter |
| 84 | Fix `translation.ts` — remove broken `DescriptionTranslation` ref, correct model, batch API | ✅ | Rewrote: `translateOnDemand` + `translateBatch`, correct model, no broken Prisma calls |
| 85 | Add `preferredLanguage` field to User model + migrate | ⬜ | Needed for auto-detect from user profile; currently falls back to `Accept-Language` header |
| 86 | Pass `Accept-Language` / user preference as default `targetLanguage` in chapter page | ⬜ | Currently always defaults to `'en'`; should auto-set based on browser locale or user profile |
| 87 | "Translated from X • Show original" banner in chapter reader | ⬜ | Show when `targetLanguage !== originalLanguage`; allow one-tap to revert. Design: subtle bar below ChapterTopBar |

### Phase 2 — Quality & Cost Controls

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 88 | Persist AI translations to DB (`FanTranslation` model, `TIER_1_OFFICIAL`) to avoid re-translating | ⬜ | Content route already scaffolds this but has a bug with `translatorId: 'system-ai'` (not a real User FK) — fix or make nullable |
| 89 | Rate-limit translation requests per user/IP (e.g. 20 chapters/day for anon) | ⬜ | Prevent abuse; use Redis or DB counter |
| 90 | Chunk large chapters into ≤50 block batches before sending to LLM | ⬜ | Prevents context-limit errors on very long chapters |

### Phase 3 — Community Translations (future)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 91 | `TranslationSuggestion` submission UI — bilingual readers can propose better translations | ⬜ | API route exists at `/api/translations/submit` |
| 92 | Voting UI for translation suggestions | ⬜ | API route exists at `/api/translations/vote` |
| 93 | Auto-promote community translation to canonical when votes > threshold | ⬜ | Promotion logic in `/api/translations/[id]` |
| 94 | `TranslatorProfile` hub — track translator reputation and language badges | ⬜ | Schema exists; needs UI in Creator Hub |
